# Dang! That's Delicious: Learn Node with Nutty Canadian 
The NodeJS tutorial by Wes Bos.

I'll keep this ReadMe short and sweet. This is only my fun with Learn Node. I kept my comments and notes in as this was for me. Not for anyone else. To clean it up would be akin to throwing away my notes and papers from college. 

This was more than what I needed when I started; however, I feel that it gave me a better idea of coming into a project midway. He did the styling already, so as I (we) wrote pug files, I had to be mindful of the classes he created. So while this is a NodeJS tutorial, it's not without style, figuratively or literally.
